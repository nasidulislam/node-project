# Meadowlark Travel Company #
## Node JS Tutorial Code ##

This is a practice application I built based on the Node JS instructional book *Web Development with Node & Express*. The book was written a long time ago I guess and a lot of the node modules used has been deprecated or are pending deprecation.

### Instructions on how to deploy the project locally ###
1. All dependencies of the project are configured in package.json. Simply clone the repository, and from the root directory of the repository, run __npm install__.
2. Then run __node meadowlark.js__ or __node app_cluster.js__. The first command will launch one server, the latter will utilize all of your machine's cpu cores to launch as many instances of the application.
